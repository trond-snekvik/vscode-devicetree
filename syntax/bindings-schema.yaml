    type: string
    description: |
      Unique identifier used for connecting nodes to bindings. Should generally follow a "vendor,type", where vendor is a unique vendor identifier, such as a ticker. The compatible identifier usually matches the filename of the binding. Examples: "nordic,nrf-gpio", "microchip,mcp2515"

  on-bus:

      If the node appears on a bus, then the bus type should be given.

      When looking for a binding for a node, the code checks if the binding for the parent node contains 'bus: <bus type>'. If it does, then only bindings with a matching 'on-bus: <bus type>' are considered. This allows the same type of device to have different bindings depending on what bus it appears on.
  bus:
    type: string
    description: |
      If the node describes a bus, then the bus type should be given.

      If the binding describes an interrupt controller, GPIO controller, pinmux device, or any other node referenced by other nodes via 'phandle-array' properties, then *-cells should be given.

      To understand the purpose of *-cells, assume that some node has

      pwms = <&pwm-ctrl 1 2>;

      where &pwm-ctrl refers to a node whose binding is this file.

      The <1 2> part of the property value is called a *specifier* (this terminology is from the devicetree specification), and contains additional data associated with the GPIO. Here, the specifier has two cells, and the node pointed at by &gpio-ctrl is expected to have '#pwm-cells = <2>'.

      *-cells gives a name to each cell in the specifier. These names are used when generating identifiers.

      Defines one or more bindings this binding inherits properties and other attributes from.
  child-binding:
    type: object
    description: |
      'child-binding' can be used when a node has children that all share the same properties. Each child gets the contents of 'child-binding' as its binding (though an explicit 'compatible = ...' on the child node takes precedence, ifa binding is found for it).

      Child bindings can also be used recursively.
